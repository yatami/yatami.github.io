                                <p>This is a project I have created while working in Reboot Interactive. In this game you build robots and test them. I was responsible with the kitchen mechanic in which you test foods made by robots. In this mechanic robots wait in a line and you evaluate them one by one according to their food in their hand by sliding the lever left or right. I made some of the robot animations. Also, in the shooting mechanic, where you shoot and destroy robots, I have made the environment destructible with the gun. I used Rayfire for this purpose. </p>

                                <p>This is a project I made completely myself. I wanted to create a game from scratch and put it on the Steam store and since my budget was low I have decided to make a game from hentai genre. Only the drawings, vocalization and music are made by freelancers; the other parts are developed by me. This game was created with a budget of 300$ and sold around 1000 copies.</p>
